The AI then posed two questions regarding specific colors and themes the user would like, offering options like bright neon colors or a pastel color palette, and whether they desired additional effects such as animations. The user confirmed their intent for a colorful design.\n\nSubsequently, the user instructed the AI to add an \"awesome\" copy, which the AI acknowledged and proceeded to create. The AI again provided options regarding the messaging for the copy and the visual style, asking about a slogan that captures the game's essence versus a simple bold statement, as well as font preferences. The AI continued to offer a checklist of potential features, including customizable color themes for UI elements and a neon glow effect. \n\nLater, the user specifically requested to change a component to blue, to which the AI confirmed it was in the process of making that adjustment. The AI offered further questions regarding the shade of blue preferred and any additional effects for the design.",
